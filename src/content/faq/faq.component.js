          <h3>Why are you so mad about money in politics?</h3>
          <p>
            Our politicians should work for us, represent us, and be accountable
            to us – the ordinary working people of AD15. Buffy benefits from
            over a million dollars spent on AD15 by the wealthiest 0.1% of
            Americans, including Trump cronies and Republicans, pitching in from
            all across the country. Some of them contribute to PACs and
            independent expenditure committees that boost her candidacy but
            aren’t supposed to coordinate with her campaign; others give direct
            donations (and plenty do both). She says she’s not accountable to
            them, but rich people know that when money talks, politicians
            listen.
          </p>
          <p>
            As socialists, we believe society should be run democratically and
            for the benefit of people, not profit. No one should face
            oppression, state violence, or go without basic necessities like
            housing, healthcare, education, and a good job.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the mega-rich don’t agree. They are engaged in a long-running,
            well-funded, and ruthless campaign to take ever more for themselves
            and leave crumbs to the rest of us. They don’t want to pay taxes,
            pay the workers that made them rich, or pay for the damage their
            profit-obsessed companies do to the world.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            To increase their profits, corporations and the mega-rich must wage
            war on working people. That is why they:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Buy elections at every level of the government through unlimited
              donations to PACs,{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              Influence policy and media by funding think tanks and foundations
              to advance their agenda,
            </li>
            <li>
              Fight tooth-and-nail against anything that would transfer
              resources, power, and security to working people, like labor
              protections, the expansion of the social safety net, and big
              reforms like Medicare for All, universal rent control, and
              universal free college tuition.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is not just about Buffy. Big donors pool their money and offer
            it to thousands of candidates like her across the country, at every
            level of government. This is how they block legislation that favors
            working people, while passing policies that favor the rich, like tax
            cuts, corporate giveaways, anti-union legislation, and harmful
            deregulation. This is enabled by the <em>Citizens United</em>{' '}
            decision that permits unlimited political spending under the guise
            that money is “free speech.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We have the resources to fix the many serious problems we face, but
            we won’t fix them by continuing to elect politicians who strike a
            progressive pose while benefiting from massive spending by the
            megarich and protecting the pro-big-business status quo at all
            costs.
          </p>
          <h3>
            I definitely don’t want to vote for Buffy. Who should I vote for
            instead?

              Jovanka Beckles
            </a>{' '}
            is a corporate-free candidate and a democratic socialist with a long
            history of fighting and winning for working people in the East Bay.
            She’s served on the Richmond City Council and is a leader in the
            Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA). On the Richmond City Council,
            Jovanka and her colleagues from the RPA took on Chevron and its
            millions and won victories like a $15 minimum wage, citywide rent
            control, and banning the box for fairness in employment.
