          <h3>What do you have against Buffy and her donors?</h3>
          <p>
            Our politicians should work for us, represent us, and be accountable
            to us – the ordinary working people of AD15. We don’t think someone
            can take ten times the salary of a state representative from the one
            percent and expect us to believe that she’s on our side.
          </p>
          <p>
            As socialists, we believe society should be run democratically and
            for the benefit of people, not profit. Ordinary people should have
            control over the things that matter. No one should face oppression,
            state violence, or go without basic necessities like housing,
            healthcare, or education.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the superwealthy don’t agree. They are engaged in a long
            running, well funded, and ruthless campaign to take ever more for
            themselves and leave crumbs to the rest of us. They don’t want to
            pay taxes, pay the workers that made them rich, or pay for the
            damageharms their profit-obsessed companies do to the world.
          </p>
          <p>To wage war on working people, the wealthy coordinate to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Buy elections at every level of the government through unlimited
              donations to dark money PACs,
            </li>
            <li>
              Influence policy and media by funding think tanks and foundations
              to advance their agenda,
            </li>
            <li>
              And fight tooth and nail against anything that would transfer
              resources, power, and security to working people, like labor
              protections, the expansion of the social safety net, and big
              reforms like Medicare for All, the repeal of Costa Hawkins, and
              universal free college tuition.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We don’t think most of these donors care much about Buffy. They pool
            their money and offer it to thousands of candidates like her across
            the country, at every level of government. This is how they block
            legislation that favors working people, while passing policies that
            favor the rich, like tax cuts, corporate giveaways, and harmful
            deregulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have the resources to fix the many serious problems we face, but
            we won’t fix them by continuing to elect politicians who put on a
            progressive face while raking in dark money and protecting the
            status quo at all costs.
          </p>

            I definitely don’t want to vote for Buffy. Who should I vote for
            instead?

              Jovanka Beckles
            </a>{' '}
            is a corporate-free candidate and a democratic socialist with a long
            history of fighting and winning for working people in the East Bay.
            She’s served on the Richmond City Council and is a leader in the
            Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA). On the Richmond City Council,
            Jovanka and her colleagues from the RPA took on Chevron and its
            millions and won victories like a $15 minimum wage, citywide rent
            control, and banning the box.

              Jovanka’s platform
            </a>{' '}
            is a bold vision for a California that works for the many, not the
            few. She knows that in a state with a $2.7 trillion GDP, we already
            have already created more than enough wealth to provide everyone
            with a stable, safe, and dignified life. Most importantly, Jovanka
            understands how power works, and that it
          </p>
          <p>
            She’ll fight for a single-payer Medicare for All system that covers
            healthcare for everyone in California. She’ll work to end Costa
            Hawkins and implement statewide rent control. Jovanka has a plan for
            free universal pre-K and a moratorium on charter schools. She
            supports labor with a $20 minimum wage and stronger protections for
            workers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Jovanka doesn’t have Buffy’s millions, she depends on
            ordinary people like you and me to talk to our neighbors and friends
            about sending her to Sacramento. Come to one of East Bay DSA’s{' '}
