          <h3>Why are you so mad about money in politics?</h3>
          <p>
            Our politicians should work for us, represent us, and be accountable
            to us – the ordinary working people of Assembly District 15. Buffy
            benefits from over a million dollars spent on AD15 by the wealthiest
            0.1% of Americans, including Trump cronies and Republicans, pitching
            in to influence this race from all across the country. Some of these
            ultrawealthy donors contribute to PACs and independent expenditure
            committees that boost Buffy’s candidacy but aren’t supposed to
            coordinate with her campaign; others give direct donations to her
            campaign (and plenty do both). She says she’s not accountable to
            them, but rich people know that money talks, and politicians listen.
          </p>
          <p>
            As socialists, we believe society should be run democratically and
            for the benefit of people, not profit. No one should face
            oppression, state violence, or go without basic necessities like
            housing, healthcare, education, and a good job.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the mega-rich don’t agree. They are engaged in a long-running,
            well-funded, and ruthless campaign to take ever more for themselves
            and leave crumbs to the rest of us. They don’t want to pay taxes,
            pay the workers that made them rich, or pay for the damage their
            profit-obsessed companies do to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            To increase their profits, corporations and the mega-rich must wage
            war on working people. That is why they:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Buy elections at every level of the government through unlimited
              donations to PACs,
            </li>
            <li>
              Influence policy and media by funding think tanks and foundations
              to advance their agenda,
            </li>
            <li>
              Fight tooth-and-nail against anything that would transfer
              resources, power, and security to working people, like labor
              protections, the expansion of the social safety net, and big
              reforms like Medicare for All, universal rent control, and
              universal free college tuition.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is not just about Buffy. Big donors pool their money and offer
            it to thousands of candidates like her across the country, at every
            level of government. This is how they block legislation that favors
            working people, while passing policies that help the rich, like tax
            cuts, corporate giveaways, anti-union legislation, and harmful
            deregulation. This is enabled by the <em>Citizens United</em>{' '}
            decision that permits unlimited political spending under the bizarre
            logic that money is “free speech.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We have the resources to fix the many serious problems we face, but
            we won’t fix them by continuing to elect politicians who strike a
            progressive pose while they benefitting from massive spending by the
            megarich.
          </p>
          <h3>

            is a corporate-free candidate and a democratic socialist with a long
            history of fighting and winning for working people in the East Bay.

            Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA). On the Richmond City Council,
            Jovanka and her colleagues from the RPA took on Chevron and its

            The big money in the AD15 race comes from capitalists who’ve made

            would they lavish huge sums on PACs like Govern for CA and EdVoice

            site. Then we clicked on “Campaign Finance” and typed “Buffy Wicks”
            into the search box. That pulled up a list of all of the donors from
            this election, which we then downloaded as a spreadsheet.
          </p>
          <p>
            For independent expenditures, we again went to Power Search, and
            clicked on (you guessed it) “Independent Expenditures.” That let us
            search for every PAC that’s spent to support the campaign and how
            much they’ve spent so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            To see who’s donated to Govern for California and other PACs in the
            race, we headed over to Cal-Access and looked for the PAC names
            under “Committees, Parties, Major Donors &amp; Slate Mailers.” That
            generated a big list of donors and dollar amounts.
